# SF-Salaries
Basic manipulation and analysis of a San Francisco government employee salary dataset using SQL. 

For this project, I used a Kaggle dataset containing information on San Francisco government employees (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/sf-salaries). Here is a basic description of the data: 

  *One way to understand how a city government works is by looking at who it employs and how its employees are compensated. This data     
   contains the names, job title, and compensation for San Francisco city employees on an annual basis from 2011 to 2014.*
